future-sight
============

We are going to see into the future, one ruby script at a time

Currently, this project can do two different things: extract the URLs currently on the news.ycombinator.com frontpage, and visit those, printing the article from those frontpage links which are blog posts.

Future updates include handling more blogs, being able to handle articles which are unknown types of blogs or not blogs at all, and building a database of words/phrases used in these articles.
